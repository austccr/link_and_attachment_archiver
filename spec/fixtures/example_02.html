<p>Victoria’s minerals industry has put the call out for exceptional women and gender diversity champions across the industry to nominate for the 2019 Victorian Women in Resources Awards.</p>\n<p>Now in their third year, the Victorian Women in Resources Awards are held in partnership between MCA Victoria and the AusIMM Women in Mining and Resources Network Victoria (WIMnet Victoria).</p>\n<p>Building the future minerals workforce means industry needs to boost its focus on increasing workforce diversity and inclusion, including gender diversity.</p>\n<p>Research and industry experience confirm diversity and inclusion increase productivity, innovation and performance – and has benefits for women and men.</p>\n<p>Encouraging women to pursue a career in mining is vital if we are to meet the growing demand for Science, Social Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths professionals in Australia’s innovative, high-skill world-class resources sector.</p>\n<p>By profiling women who are contributing to the success of the resources sector as well as championing diversity, the awards program assists in creating a more inclusive environment for women within the industry through the recognition of excellence.</p>\n<p>The 2019 Awards feature five categories, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Exceptional Woman in Victorian Resources</li>\n<li>Exceptional Young Woman in Victorian Resources</li>\n<li>Gender Diversity Champion in Victorian Resources</li>\n<li>Outstanding Victorian Trade, Operator or Technician</li>\n<li>Excellence in Diversity Programs and Performance Award.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Victoria’s resources industry extends from minerals operations and export-focused mining equipment, technology and services companies in regional Victoria to the corporate offices of major global mining companies in Melbourne.</p>\n<p>Winners in each category are elevated to finalists in the Women in Resources National Awards to be held in September. </p>\n<p>At last year’s national awards, Victorian woman Melanie McCarthy of Mandalay Resources was recognised as the winner of the Exceptional Woman in Australian Resources.</p>\n<p>Applicants have until Monday 13 May to enter with winners in each of the five categories announced at a ceremony in June.</p>\n<p>Application information and forms are available <a href="http://minerals.org.au/events/victorian-women-resources-awards-2019">here.</a></p>\n<p>ends</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="media media-element-container media-default">\n<div id="file-3130" class="file file-document file-application-pdf">\n\n        <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/190308-exceptional-victorian-women-resources-sought-2019-awardspdf-0">190308 Exceptional Victorian women in resources sought for 2019 awards.pdf</a></h2>\n    \n  \n  <div class="content">\n    <span class="file"><img class="file-icon" alt="PDF icon" title="application/pdf" src="/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png"><a href="https://minerals.org.au/sites/default/files/190308%20Exceptional%20Victorian%20women%20in%20resources%20sought%20for%202019%20awards_0.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=54806">190308 Exceptional Victorian women in resources sought for 2019 awards.pdf</a></span>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n
