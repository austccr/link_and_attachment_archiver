<p>Innovation, people and skills combined with technological advances will deliver a more globally competitive minerals sector that delivers fulfilling careers in highly paid, high-skilled jobs.</p>\n<p>Today’s release of EY’s <em>Skills Map for the Future of Work</em> – commissioned by MCA – provides a comprehensive examination of future skills and training and technology trends in the Australian minerals industry.</p>\n<p>Key findings by EY include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>77 per cent of jobs in Australian mining will be enhanced or redesigned due to technology within the next five years</li>\n<li>Productivity increases up to 23 per cent can be achieved with the rollout of new technologies, costing more than $35 billion</li>\n<li>An injection of $5 billion to $13 billion in workforce capability will be needed over the next decade to unlock future productivity gains</li>\n<li>Australian education and training systems need to be modernised to deliver higher certification and fit-for-purpose degrees.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>New technology and innovative practices will enhance the performance and productivity of 42 per cent of Australian mining jobs, with a further 35 per cent of occupations being redesigned and upskilled leading to more valuable employment opportunities.  Automation will give the opportunity for reskilling into other areas.</p>\n<p>EY’s study also identified that Australia’s education and training system needs to be modernised by offering improved course structures and enhanced movement between universities and the vocational education sectors.</p>\n<p>Future university degrees will need to have a mix of the latest scientific, technical and trade skills along with soft skills including collaboration, team building, communication and creativity.</p>\n<p>A decade-long investment by industry and government in general skills incorporating mathematics, data analytics, computing and change management will boost productivity in the minerals sector.</p>\n<p>Jobs that will be made future-ready through large investments will include metal fitters, machinists, building and engineering technical and experts in electronics and mechatronics.</p>\n<p>For example, a shot-firer working on a drilling team will have the opportunity in Australia’s future minerals workforce to use drone technology to monitor automated rigs.</p>\n<p>Australian mining will continue to take advantage of innovation, technology and new ways of working to create high-paying, high skilled jobs.</p>\n<p>The Skills Map includes two major reports: <a href="https://www.minerals.org.au/news/future-work-changing-skills-landscape-miners">The Future of Work: the Changing Skills Landscape for Miners</a> and <a href="https://www.minerals.org.au/news/future-work-economic-implications-technology-and-digital-mining">The Future of Work: The economic implications of technology and digital mining</a>. </p>\n<p>ends </p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="media media-element-container media-default">\n<div id="file-3079" class="file file-document file-application-pdf">\n\n        <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/190214-powering-future-australian-mining-people-innovation-and-modern-educationpdf">190214 Powering the future of Australian mining with people innovation and modern education.pdf</a></h2>\n    \n  \n  <div class="content">\n    <span class="file"><img class="file-icon" alt="PDF icon" title="application/pdf" src="/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png"><a href="https://minerals.org.au/sites/default/files/190214%20Powering%20the%20future%20of%20Australian%20mining%20with%20people%20innovation%20and%20modern%20education.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=137748">190214 Powering the future of Australian mining with people innovation and modern education.pdf</a></span>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n
