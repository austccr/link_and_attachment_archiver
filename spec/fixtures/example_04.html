<p>Australia’s world-leading minerals industry today launched the next phase of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDgGTjJ1KnY">industry advertising campaign</a> focusing on effective mine rehabilitation and how mining and farming work together.</p>\n<p>Filmed at New Acland Mine in Queensland’s Darling Downs, the campaign outlines the great work being done by Australian mining companies to restore land after mining so it can be used for other purposes including agriculture.</p>\n<p>The Australian minerals sector is proud of our world leadership on mine rehabilitation and understands that land rehabilitation is fundamental to responsible mining. </p>\n<p>The Australian minerals industry recognises its responsibility as a temporary custodian of land to contribute to sustainable land use outcomes.</p>\n<p>Planning for rehabilitation takes place long before mining commences, and rehabilitation is undertaken progressively during the life of a mine wherever practical.</p>\n<p>The industry’s approach to land rehabilitation has improved significantly over past decades – an evolution driven by sustained investment in land rehabilitation techniques, evolving corporate values, community expectations and government regulation.</p>\n<p>Audience research shows strong support for MCA’s approach, with feedback indicating appreciation for a fresh new perspective on Australian mining told by real people.</p>\n<p>The campaign also focuses on how mining and agriculture work together, outlining the results of scientific grazing trials at New Acland showing that cattle grazed on rehabilitated land do as well or better as those on undisturbed land.</p>\n<p>The ads will be shown to Australians through print, radio, digital and out of home outlets and on free to air and subscription television through to July 2019.</p>\n<p>MCA has registered as a political campaigner under the <em>Commonwealth Electoral Act (1918)</em>, following changes to the law last year.</p>\n<p>While the campaign is educational and not for the purpose of creating or communicating electoral matters, in the interests of transparency and disclosure an application for registration was lodged on Friday 8 February, 2019.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>ends</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="media media-element-container media-default">\n<div id="file-3096" class="file file-document file-application-pdf">\n\n        <h2 class="element-invisible"><a href="/files/190211-new-campaign-shows-theres-more-australian-miningpdf-0">190211 New campaign shows there's more to Australian mining.pdf</a></h2>\n    \n  \n  <div class="content">\n    <span class="file"><img class="file-icon" alt="PDF icon" title="application/pdf" src="/modules/file/icons/application-pdf.png"><a href="https://minerals.org.au/sites/default/files/190211%20New%20campaign%20shows%20there%27s%20more%20to%20Australian%20mining_0.pdf" type="application/pdf; length=21327">190211 New campaign shows there's more to Australian mining.pdf</a></span>  </div>\n\n  \n</div>\n</div>\n
